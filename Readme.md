# RPG Maker MV Test Starter Template

This template is designed to make it exceedingly easy to write
test games and develop plugins by harnessing the power of MochaJS
and Typescript definition files.

## Getting Started

1. If you don't already have a legal copy of RPG Maker MV, please buy it. It will make editing plugin parameters easier.

2. Download NodeJS if you have not already. It is used to setup dependencies this template uses. It can be found at it's [homepage](https://nodejs.org/en).

3. Run `node Install.js` to grab all the recommended dependencies and setup the scripts. You must have the `demo` project present. 

4. To automatically run a test, type `npm run debug` and hit enter. This will create a new window where all the tests will show up. Depending on the number of map files and other things, it may take some time to execute.

5. To properly build it, mark the `@types`, `tests` , and `node_modules` folders as hidden. This will prevent them from being built into the game.

## Contributing

If you see a way to improve the test code or see an oversight, please let me know. I will do my best to respond and merge pull requests in a timely manner.
