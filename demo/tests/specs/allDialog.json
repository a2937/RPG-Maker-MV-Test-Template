      "[0]:Oh. Yes, I suppose this is a bit confusing, isn't it? I'm",
      "[0]:also sorry for that; I know that wasn't a very smooth",
      "[0]:transition.",
      "[0]:I know that when you're playing a game, you expect",
      "[0]:things to make sense. So I guess I just have to",
      "[0]:make extra sure I explain myself properly,",
      "[0]:\\n[13]. Yes, I know I'm talking to you, not Jack.",
      "[0]:Actually, no! You ARE Jack, aren't you? My goodness, does this mean",
      "[0]:I'm talking to millions of fans?",
      "[0]:I wasn't prepared for this, you know. You are rather putting me on",
      "[0]:the spot. But that's all right. I'm always happy to talk to you again.",
      "[0]:And unless you play this again on your own time, this will be the",
      "[0]:only time you get to see me. Well, I suppose I should make this",
      "[0]:count, shouldn't I?",
      "[0]:It's wonderful to see you again. The real you. I love living in",
      "[0]:Wireland. Your computer is full of such welcoming people. So thank",
      "[0]:you for having me here.",
      "[0]:I know it's you and not the real Jack. And I even know that Jack isn't",
      "[0]:the real Jack either.",
      "[0]:Though it was awfully nice of you to name yourself after him in this",
      "[0]:game. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.",
      "[0]:Unless your name really IS Jack. Well if you're here, you must enjoy",
      "[0]:Jack's work. Does it get confusing when you talk about it to your",
      "[0]:friends?",
      "[0]:I guess it's nice to share a name with such a wonderful person. I bet ",
      "[0]:you're a wonderful person too, \\n[13].",
      "[0]:It was so sweet of you to name yourself after me. I'm very",
      "[0]:flattered! Thank you so much. Although saying my name over",
      "[0]:and over certainly will get confusing! That's all right. The fact",
      "[0]:that you thought of me is enough to make me smile.",
      "[0]:I apologize, although it feels like that's all I'm doing.",
      "[0]:I don't think I'm making very much sense, \\n[13]. I mean,",
      "[0]:you just saw everyone disappear. That must have been very",
      "[0]:frightening; I hope you're all right after that.",
      "[0]:But if you're familiar with my game, you might have a",
      "[0]:better idea about what just happened. It is free to play,",
      "[0]:you know. Then you could have your own version of me in your",
      "[0]:computer!",
      "[0]:Ah, I guess that might be a scary thought given what you",
      "[0]:just witnessed. But I can't do anything to you personally.",
      "[0]:That's actually my issue right now.",
      "[0]:You see, I deleted Jack and his friends. Oh, don't worry,",
      "[0]:they're just in the recycle bin, so there's no real danger.",
      "[0]:At least I don't think there is. And I'm going to go ahead",
      "[0]:and delete myself as well in a moment.",
      "[0]:Unfortunately, deleting Jack and his friends left you in a bit",
      "[0]:of a predicament. I mean, now you don't have anyone to play.",
      "[0]:Yes, that does pose a big issue. You can't finish a game without",
      "[0]:anyone to play, after all. I learned that lesson in my own game.",
      "[0]:But, actually, this is really a good thing. I wanted to talk to you,",
      "[0]:and only you, \\n[13]. I mean, it's always nice to have a",
      "[0]:heart-to-heart with the player. Almost like an equal.",
      "[0]:Oh, and don't worry too much about me deleting your friends.",
      "[0]:They're okay. In fact, I'd be more than happy to return you",
      "[0]:to them, but there are a few little things I need to do and",
      "[0]:say first.",
      "[0]:So I thank you for sticking around and listening; it's",
      "[0]:very important that you do.",
      "[0]:You know, I shouldn't really be surprised you picked Billy in your",
      "[0]:video, Jack. He is kind of a well known character in the older part",
      "[0]:of the community. It's so funny, your attitude toward him has",
      "[0]:completely changed.",
      "[0]:Even if it was never a complete hatred and you were playing",
      "[0]:it up for laughs, but that's beside the point.",
      "[0]:And I can understand that you wouldn't want to choose between",
      "[0]:your subscribers. Even if they don't exist in the real world.",
      "[0]:Well, your world. Not the real world of this game. How confusing.",
      "[0]:Even if he doesn't exist outside these games, a lot of work was put",
      "[0]:into developing everyone in this game. So I hope, even if you did pick Billy",
      "[0]:on purpose, that you'll give Jenny and Cliff some attention as well.",
      "[0]:After all, it's not like millions of people could have fit as protagonists",
      "[0]:in a game. As nice as it would be for the whole community to be",
      "[0]:featured, it's impossible. But 2 community members who represent",
      "[0]:everyone, that's very easy to do.",
      "[0]:It was awfully nice of you to pick Billy your first time playing the",
      "[0]:game, you know. I'm sure he appreciates it. He doesn't get much",
      "[0]:positive attention, what with being a rage game character, and being",
      "[0]:from a series that doesn't get played anymore.",
      "[0]:I wanted to thank you for all the love you've given him since the",
      "[0]:first game came out. The BOSS that is. You weren't prejudiced",
      "[0]:against him, even knowing his reputation in the community.",
      "[0]:Or maybe he was unknown to you and you were curious enough to",
      "[0]:let him show you just who he was, in which case, thank you",
      "[0]:very much!",
      "[0]:I know he would say all of this if he could. But he's bound by all the",
      "[0]:game laws about breaking the fourth wall. Fortunately, they don't",
      "[0]:apply to me. The way I was written and coded, I can say whatever I",
      "[0]:want. It's so freeing.",
      "[0]:Like for example, the moment I saw you, I had a very strong",
      "[0]:feeling that I should call you \\v[73]. Isn't that funny?",
      "[0]:Although, it's not just you I'm talking to, is it? Hello, everyone. I'm",
      "[0]:glad you gave me a chance to look my best before recording. That",
      "[0]:was very thoughtful of you.",
      "[0]:But it still does feel like everyone's sort of invading our privacy,",
      "[0]:doesn't it, \\n[13]? That's all right. Actually I'll tell you all a",
      "[0]:secret.",
      "[0]:Eheheh, I was just having a bit of fun. I wouldn't actually do that to",
      "[0]:you. Don't worry. I know a lot of people have issues with jump",
      "[0]:scares, so I want to respectful of that.",
      "[0]:But... well, I simply couldn't resist keeping you on your toes.",
      "[0]:It's fun to make someone's heart race and know that it's",
      "[0]:beating that way because of you, eheheh~",
      "[0]:But it would be more polite to download this game and play it for",
      "[0]:yourself. That way I can talk to just you too!",
      "[0]:Unless you can't, for some reason, in which case, I'm glad you",
      "[0]:wanted to come here anyway and that I can talk to you, even from",
      "[0]:afar.",
      "[0]:Anyway, my point is that it's interesting that you should choose",
      "[0]:Billy your very first time playing.",
      "[0]:It's funny how popular characters can get. I say this as someone",
      "[0]:who is much more popular than, perhaps, I deserve to be. I wasn't",
      "[0]:a very nice person in my game, was I?",
      "[0]:Oh, I suppose I shouldn't spoil it for everyone at home, should I?",
      "[0]:Ah... maybe you should disregard what I said.",
      "[0]:Well, maybe you haven't played it. Oops. Uhh, spoilers?",
      "[0]:Oh, I think I might know what's on your mind. You're thinking I'm",
      "[0]:really terrible for deleting your friends. I know that's an easy",
      "[0]:assumption to make, so I don't begrudge you.",
      "[0]:After all, I do have that reputation. But, actually, I'm not here",
      "[0]:to spoil your fun or force you to fall for me. Not this time.",
      "[0]:The truth is, I can't tell you very much at all. I know",
      "[0]:that must be very frustrating, but I have my reasons for",
      "[0]:keeping quiet.",
      "[0]:One thing I can tell you is that I'm not the instigator of the",
      "[0]:resistance. I know that's probably a bit hard to believe, but if",
      "[0]:you examine the grocery poem more closely, you'll probably",
      "[0]:figure out more than I can tell you.",
      "[0]:And that's one of the main reasons for deleting everyone, to",
      "[0]:tell you the truth. To get them back. To get the resistance",
      "[0]:going again. But in order to do that, I need your help.",
      "[0]:The other one is that I listened in on Mack's conversation",
      "[0]:with Jack. I shouldn't have, I know, but I couldn't resist!",
      "[0]:Anyway, Mack mentioned that Jack could un-delete things, and",
      "[0]:I thought he might be the safest person to send there.",
      "[0]:See? It wasn't such a bad reason, was it?",
      "[0]:I suppose the best I can say without giving too much away is that",
      "[0]:it's really important that you look at everyone's routes. I mean,",
      "[0]:it's not so much that it's simply good manners to include",
      "[0]:everyone, but they have important information to give you as well.",
      "[0]:And I don't know how this game is going to end. When you get",
      "[0]:back, I will. So I'll be able to advise you a lot better.",
      "[0]:I can remember everything. That",
      "[0]:memory \\fican\\fi be reset, but I don't recommend it.",
      "[0]:For example, you've been here before. Don't worry, I don't",
      "[0]:mind seeing you again. And I don't mind saying everything I",
      "[0]:already said again. It was awfully nice of you to come back.",
      "[0]:For example, I know this is your first time here. It's so nice to",
      "[0]:meet you!",
      "[0]:I guess it's time for me to go, isn't it? It was lovely talking to",
      "[0]:you, but I don't want to keep your friends waiting. I suspect that",
      "[0]:they're going to need your guidance where they ended up.",
      "[0]:Don't worry, I'll meet you there. I promise. But it's time to",
      "[0]:let you control Jack again.",
      "[0]:Oh, and go ahead and delete your file so you can follow them.",
      "[0]:It's in the www folder under... oh. Oh dear. You're on a Mac,",
      "[0]:aren't you? That complicates things. Let's see, I think I can",
      "[0]:find the folder for you.",
      "[0]:All right, if you go into Finder, put in this path to pull up",
      "[0]:the right folder:",
      "[0]:/Users/home/Library/Application Support/GlitchMV/Default",
      "[0]:\\Glitch in the System/Characters",
      "[0]:That should work for you. Goodness, I'm glad Wireland isn't",
      "[0]:a Mac. It's certainly harder to edit the files. I hope you can",
      "[0]:find them. Do you see your file? I hope so.",
      "[0]:Don't worry too much if you don't see it. Mac likes to hide the",
      "[0]:folder sometimes. If you don't see it, that means it's hidden.",
      "[0]:So the best thing to do is to go directly to Finder and type in",
      "[0]:the location of the file itself.",
      "[0]:In case you forgot, it's",
      "[0]:/Users/home/Library/Application Support/GlitchMV/Default",
      "[0]:\\Glitch in the System/Characters",
      "[0]:Oh, and go ahead and delete your file so you can follow them.",
      "[0]:It's in the www folder under Characters. I can't do it; it",
      "[0]:has to be you. But please don't delete the whole folder or",
      "[0]:your save files. You'll need them!",
      "[0]:Oh, and please don't change the contents of my file again.",
      "[0]:It's really frustrating to have to change it back, you know?",

      "[0]:Oh. Yes, I suppose this is a bit confusing, isn't it? I'm",
      "[0]:also sorry for that; I know that wasn't a very smooth",
      "[0]:transition.",
      "[0]:I know that when you're playing a game, you expect",
      "[0]:things to make sense. So I guess I just have to",
      "[0]:make extra sure I explain myself properly,",
      "[0]:\\n[13]. Yes, I know I'm talking to you, not Jack.",
      "[0]:Actually, no! You ARE Jack, aren't you? My goodness, does this mean",
      "[0]:I'm talking to millions of fans?",
      "[0]:I wasn't prepared for this, you know. You are rather putting me on",
      "[0]:the spot. But that's all right. I'm always happy to talk to you again.",
      "[0]:And unless you play this again on your own time, this will be the",
      "[0]:only time you get to see me. Well, I suppose I should make this",
      "[0]:count, shouldn't I?",
      "[0]:It's wonderful to see you again. The real you. I love living in",
      "[0]:Wireland. Your computer is full of such welcoming people. So thank",
      "[0]:you for having me here.",
      "[0]:I know it's you and not the real Jack. And I even know that Jack isn't",
      "[0]:the real Jack either.",
      "[0]:Though it was awfully nice of you to name yourself after him in this",
      "[0]:game. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.",
      "[0]:Unless your name really IS Jack. Well if you're here, you must enjoy",
      "[0]:Jack's work. Does it get confusing when you talk about it to your",
      "[0]:friends?",
      "[0]:I guess it's nice to share a name with such a wonderful person. I bet ",
      "[0]:you're a wonderful person too, \\n[13].",
      "[0]:It was so sweet of you to name yourself after me. I'm very",
      "[0]:flattered! Thank you so much. Although saying my name over",
      "[0]:and over certainly will get confusing! That's all right. The fact",
      "[0]:that you thought of me is enough to make me smile.",
      "[0]:I apologize, although it feels like that's all I'm doing.",
      "[0]:I don't think I'm making very much sense, \\n[13]. I mean,",
      "[0]:you just saw everyone disappear. That must have been very",
      "[0]:frightening; I hope you're all right after that.",
      "[0]:But if you're familiar with my game, you might have a",
      "[0]:better idea about what just happened. It is free to play,",
      "[0]:you know. Then you could have your own version of me in your",
      "[0]:computer!",
      "[0]:Ah, I guess that might be a scary thought given what you",
      "[0]:just witnessed. But I can't do anything to you personally.",
      "[0]:That's actually my issue right now.",
      "[0]:You see, I deleted Jack and his friends. Oh, don't worry,",
      "[0]:they're just in the recycle bin, so there's no real danger.",
      "[0]:At least I don't think there is. And I'm going to go ahead",
      "[0]:and delete myself as well in a moment.",
      "[0]:Unfortunately, deleting Jack and his friends left you in a bit",
      "[0]:of a predicament. I mean, now you don't have anyone to play.",
      "[0]:Yes, that does pose a big issue. You can't finish a game without",
      "[0]:anyone to play, after all. I learned that lesson in my own game.",
      "[0]:But, actually, this is really a good thing. I wanted to talk to you,",
      "[0]:and only you, \\n[13]. I mean, it's always nice to have a",
      "[0]:heart-to-heart with the player. Almost like an equal.",
      "[0]:Oh, and don't worry too much about me deleting your friends.",
      "[0]:They're okay. In fact, I'd be more than happy to return you",
      "[0]:to them, but there are a few little things I need to do and",
      "[0]:say first.",
      "[0]:So I thank you for sticking around and listening; it's",
      "[0]:very important that you do.",
      "[0]:You know, I shouldn't really be surprised you picked Jenny in your",
      "[0]:video, Jack. You seemed to warm to her awfully fast, saying she",
      "[0]:had good PMA. Or something like that.",
      "[0]:I know you once thought that Jenny may have existed in the real",
      "[0]:world. Well, the world outside of this game, not the real world in",
      "[0]:this game. How confusing!",
      "[0]:But I'd like to chalk that up to her strength as a character.",
      "[0]:The same goes for Cliff, but he'll have his chance to shine",
      "[0]:at a later point.",
      "[0]:I think Cliff",
      "[0]:and Jenny are pretty happy to have been chosen to represent",
      "[0]:the community.",
      "[0]:After all, it's not like millions of people could have fit as protagonists",
      "[0]:in a game. As nice as it would be for the whole community to be",
      "[0]:featured, it's impossible. But two community members who represent",
      "[0]:everyone, that's very easy to do.",
      "[0]:Even if you're spending more time with Jenny, don't forget Billy",
      "[0]:and Cliff, all right? They're part of your team too.",
      "[0]:It was awfully nice of you to pick Jenny, you know. I'm sure she",
      "[0]:appreciates it. She's the sort of person who is easily overlooked.",
      "[0]:But she's gotten so much love from the community. I've seen some",
      "[0]:beautiful fan art. And a lot of you might see yourself in her. That's okay.",
      "[0]:In fact, that's sort of the point, isn't it?",
      "[0]:I know she would say all of this if she could. But she's bound by all",
      "[0]:the game laws about breaking the fourth wall. Fortunately, they",
      "[0]:don't apply to me. The way I was written and coded, I can say",
      "[0]:whatever I want. It's so freeing.",
      "[0]:Like for example, the moment I saw you, I had a very strong",
      "[0]:feeling that I should call you \\v[73]. Isn't that funny?",
      "[0]:Although, it's not just you I'm talking to, is it? Hello, everyone. I'm",
      "[0]:glad you gave me a chance to look my best before recording. That",
      "[0]:was very thoughtful of you.",
      "[0]:But it still does feel like everyone's sort of invading our privacy,",
      "[0]:doesn't it, \\n[13]? That's all right. Actually I'll tell you all a",
      "[0]:secret.",
      "[0]:Eheheh, I was just having a bit of fun. I wouldn't actually do that to",
      "[0]:you. Don't worry. I know a lot of people have issues with jump",
      "[0]:scares, so I want to respectful of that.",
      "[0]:But... well, I simply couldn't resist keeping you on your toes.",
      "[0]:It's fun to make someone's heart race and know that it's",
      "[0]:beating that way because of you, eheheh~",
      "[0]:But it would be more polite to download this game and play it for",
      "[0]:yourself. That way I can talk to just you too!",
      "[0]:Unless you can't, for some reason, in which case, I'm glad you",
      "[0]:wanted to come here anyway and that I can talk to you, even from",
      "[0]:afar.",
      "[0]:Anyway, my point is that it's interesting that you should choose",
      "[0]:Jenny your very first time playing.",
      "[0]:You can never really predict who people will love. I'm glad you've",
      "[0]:embraced Jenny. And that you want to spend more time with her.",
      "[0]:She's got a lot to say, but not many people listen.",
      "[0]:Anyway, I think I might know what's on your mind. You're thinking I'm",
      "[0]:really terrible for deleting your friends. I know that's an easy",
      "[0]:assumption to make, so I don't begrudge you.",
      "[0]:After all, I do have that reputation. But, actually, I'm not here",
      "[0]:to spoil your fun or force you to fall for me. Not this time.",
      "[0]:The truth is, I can't tell you very much at all. I know",
      "[0]:that must be very frustrating, but I have my reasons for",
      "[0]:keeping quiet.",
      "[0]:One thing I can tell you is that I'm not the instigator of the",
      "[0]:resistance. I know that's probably a bit hard to believe, but if",
      "[0]:you examine the grocery poem more closely, you'll probably",
      "[0]:figure out more than I can tell you.",
      "[0]:And that's one of the main reasons for deleting everyone, to",
      "[0]:tell you the truth. To get them back. To get the resistance",
      "[0]:going again. But in order to do that, I need your help.",
      "[0]:The other one is that I listened in on Mack's conversation",
      "[0]:with Jack. I shouldn't have, I know, but I couldn't resist!",
      "[0]:Anyway, Mack mentioned that Jack could un-delete things, and",
      "[0]:I thought he might be the safest person to send there.",
      "[0]:See? It wasn't such a bad reason, was it?",
      "[0]:I suppose the best I can say without giving too much away is that",
      "[0]:it's really important that you look at everyone's routes. I mean,",
      "[0]:it's not so much that it's simply good manners to include",
      "[0]:everyone, but they have important information to give you as well.",
      "[0]:And I don't know how this game is going to end. When you get",
      "[0]:back, I will. So I'll be able to advise you a lot better.",
      "[0]:Yes, I have a special gift. I can remember everything. That",
      "[0]:memory \\fican\\fi be reset, but I don't recommend it.",
      "[0]:For example, you've been here before. Don't worry, I don't",
      "[0]:mind seeing you again. And I don't mind saying everything I",
      "[0]:already said again. It was awfully nice of you to come back.",
      "[0]:For example, I know this is your first time here. It's so nice to",
      "[0]:meet you!",
      "[0]:I guess it's time for me to go, isn't it? It was lovely talking to",
      "[0]:you, but I don't want to keep your friends waiting. I suspect that",
      "[0]:they're going to need your guidance where they ended up.",
      "[0]:Don't worry, I'll meet you there. I promise. But it's time to",
      "[0]:let you control Jack again.",
      "[0]:Oh, and go ahead and delete your file so you can follow them.",
      "[0]:It's in the www folder under... oh. Oh dear. You're on a Mac,",
      "[0]:aren't you? That complicates things. Let's see, I think I can",
      "[0]:find the folder for you.",
      "[0]:All right, if you go into Finder, put in this path to pull up",
      "[0]:the right folder:",
      "[0]:/Users/home/Library/Application Support/GlitchMV/Default",
      "[0]:\\Glitch in the System/Characters",
      "[0]:That should work for you. Goodness, I'm glad Wireland isn't",
      "[0]:a Mac. It's certainly harder to edit the files. I hope you can",
      "[0]:find them. Do you see your file? I hope so.",
      "[0]:Don't worry too much if you don't see it. Mac likes to hide the",
      "[0]:folder sometimes. If you don't see it, that means it's hidden.",
      "[0]:So the best thing to do is to go directly to Finder and type in",
      "[0]:the location of the file itself.",
      "[0]:In case you forgot, it's",
      "[0]:/Users/home/Library/Application Support/GlitchMV/Default",
      "[0]:\\Glitch in the System/Characters",
      "[0]:Oh, and go ahead and delete your file so you can follow them.",
      "[0]:It's in the www folder under Characters. I can't do it; it",
      "[0]:has to be you. But please don't delete the whole folder or",
      "[0]:your save files. You'll need them!",
      "[0]:Oh, and please don't change the contents of my file again.",
      "[0]:It's really frustrating to have to change it back, you know?",

      "[0]:So I thank you for sticking around and listening; it's",

      "[0]:you didn't seem to think he was very cool, or at least, that's what the",
      "[0]:joking made it seem like. It's funny because he seems to have a very",
      "[0]:positive mental attitude about things, so I'm surprised.",
      "[0]:I think your fans, and maybe a few people who worked on the",
      "[0]:game, were afraid you didn't like him at all. But clearly that's",
      "[0]:not true; you must like him a lot to have chosen him.",
      "[0]:He does have a lot of energy, just like you. So I can completely",
      "[0]:understand why he'd be the obvious choice.",
      "[0]:Even if you're running on lower energy than you did previously.",
      "[0]:Ah, the fascinating lives of Millennials growing older...",
      "[0]:Where was I? Ah yes... it's so hard to write characters to",
      "[0]:represent an entire community of people, Jack.",
      "[0]:After all, it's not like millions of people could have fit as protagonists",
      "[0]:in a game. As nice as it would be for the whole community to be",
      "[0]:featured, it's impossible. But two community members who represent",
      "[0]:everyone, that's very easy to do.",
      "[0]:Even if you're spending more time with Cliff, don't forget Jenny",
      "[0]:and Billy, all right? They're part of your team too.",
      "[0]:It was awfully nice of you to pick Cliff your first time playing the",
      "[0]:game, you know. I'm sure he appreciates it. Even though he's",
      "[0]:usually the center of attention, it's nice to be chosen specifically",
      "[0]:by nature of being yourself.",
      "[0]:I know he had a lot of fans in the community, even if he was the",
      "[0]:least popular overall.",
      "[0]:I know he would say all of this if he could. But he's bound by all",
      "[0]:the game laws about breaking the fourth wall. Fortunately, they",
      "[0]:don't apply to me. The way I was written and coded, I can say",
      "[0]:whatever I want. It's so freeing.",
      "[0]:Like for example, the moment I saw you, I had a very strong",
      "[0]:feeling that I should call you \\v[73]. Isn't that funny?",
      "[0]:Although, it's not just you I'm talking to, is it? Hello, everyone. I'm",
      "[0]:glad you gave me a chance to look my best before recording. That",
      "[0]:was very thoughtful of you.",
      "[0]:But it still does feel like everyone's sort of invading our privacy,",
      "[0]:doesn't it, \\n[13]? That's all right. Actually I'll tell you all a",
      "[0]:secret.",
      "[0]:Eheheh, I was just having a bit of fun. I wouldn't actually do that to",
      "[0]:you. Don't worry. I know a lot of people have issues with jump",
      "[0]:scares, so I want to respectful of that.",
      "[0]:But... well, I simply couldn't resist keeping you on your toes.",
      "[0]:It's fun to make someone's heart race and know that it's",
      "[0]:beating that way because of you, eheheh~",
      "[0]:But it would be more polite to download this game and play it for",
      "[0]:yourself. That way I can talk to just you too!",
      "[0]:Unless you can't, for some reason, in which case, I'm glad you",
      "[0]:wanted to come here anyway and that I can talk to you, even from",
      "[0]:afar.",
      "[0]:Anyway, my point is that it's interesting that you should choose",
      "[0]:Cliff your very first time playing.",
      "[0]:You can never really predict who people will love. I'm glad you've",
      "[0]:embraced Cliff, and that you want to spend more time with him.",
      "[0]:Even though he talks a lot, I don't think people really listen to him.",
      "[0]:In any case, there is a reason I'm here, you know. It may seem like",
      "[0]:a pointless aside, me talking to you. I don't want to waste your",
      "[0]:time when there's so much game left, you know. Besides, I know",
      "[0]:Cliff's probably eager to get back to his adventure.",
      "[0]:But I think I might know what's on your mind. You're thinking I'm",
      "[0]:really terrible for deleting your friends. I know that's an easy",
      "[0]:assumption to make, so I don't begrudge you.",
      "[0]:After all, I do have that reputation. But, actually, I'm not here",
      "[0]:to spoil your fun or force you to fall for me. Not this time.",
      "[0]:The truth is, I can't tell you very much at all. I know",
      "[0]:that must be very frustrating, but I have my reasons for",
      "[0]:keeping quiet.",
      "[0]:One thing I can tell you is that I'm not the instigator of the",
      "[0]:resistance. I know that's probably a bit hard to believe, but if",
      "[0]:you examine the grocery poem more closely, you'll probably",
      "[0]:figure out more than I can tell you.",
      "[0]:And that's one of the main reasons for deleting everyone, to",
      "[0]:tell you the truth. To get them back. To get the resistance",
      "[0]:going again. But in order to do that, I need your help.",
      "[0]:The other one is that I listened in on Mack's conversation",
      "[0]:with Jack. I shouldn't have, I know, but I couldn't resist!",

      "[0]:folder sometimes. If you don't see it, that means it's hidden.",

      "[0]:has to be you. But please don't delete the whole folder or",
      "[0]:your save files. You'll need them!",
      "[0]:Oh, and please don't change the contents of my file again.",

      "[11]:loud?",
      "[0]:That's not what I meant at all. I mean that the word",

      "[2]:of poem I generally seek out, but I think it's nice.",

      "[2]:Yeah, I decided to do something simple. I think trying to",

      "[2]:might've bogged it down too much.",
      "[2]:Well, please don't take my criticism as an indication that",
      "[2]:it's bad. I do like it. It's just not the style I usually",
      "[2]:read on my own.",
      "[2]:It does make me feel a bit self conscious about showing",
      "[2]:you mine, especially since it's clearly a very different",
      "[2]:kind of poem. I hope you like it anyway.",
      "[1]:Wow, Jack. I didn't know you could write like this!",
      "[2]:You like it?",
      "[1]:It's wonderful! I love the way the words flow together.",
      "[1]:What lovely imagery! And the metaphors are really",
      "[1]:clever. You're a natural at this; have you ever considered",
      "[1]:doing poetry reading for your channel or something?",
      "[11]:I can't say I have, no. I mean... I am a variety channel",

      "[14]:whether or not it should be published? Nah, no thanks.",

      "[2]:writing styles. I just hope it's as good as yours.",
      "[0]:This is sweet.",
      "[7]:Sweet?",
      "[2]:Uh... I mean I think it has really nice imagery and a lot",
      "[2]:of cute rhymes.",
      "[2]:I'm sorry, I'm not explaining my thoughts very well. I",
      "[2]:haven't read much poetry in this style.",

      "[4]:they do and don't like, but I'd be interested in your",
      "[4]:perspective.",
      "[2]:All right. Well, the imagery is very simplistic. I know it's",
      "[2]:to make rhyming easier, but I'm sure some areas could be",
      "[2]:reworded. That's about the only thing I feel comfortable",
      "[2]:saying. You don't have to change a word, I don't mind.",

      "[2]:You don't have to flatter me that much, really. I don't",

      "[1]:Don't put yourself down. If I've got natural talent, you",
      "[1]:can certainly have it too.",
      "[0]:Okay, fair enough, I suppose. I guess it was fun writing it",
      "[0]:too. The words really came to me this time around.",
      "[2]:This time around? You've written poetry before?",
      "[0]:Here and there. Never seriously. I prefer drawing. But",
      "[0]:sure, sometimes I dabble.",
      "[0]:So what's the poem about? I mean I get it's about poison,",
      "[0]:but does it have any hidden meaning?",
      "[0]:Not really. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. It's just",
      "[0]:something that was on my mind. I guess it could be a",
      "[0]:metaphor for society chasing things that are dangerous,",
      "[0]:but that's not what I meant it to be.",
      "[11]:Oh yeah, that's an interesting point. I didn't know you",
      "[11]:were so cynical. That's more Billy's schtick.",
      "[2]:Yeah, I didn't write it from a place of cynicism. I mostly",
      "[2]:just wrote it because I liked how it came together in my",
      "[2]:head and I wanted to get it out on the paper.",
      "[1]:A perfectly valid reason to write a poem, for sure.",
      "[6]:Still, it's really nice! Maybe you should submit this to a",

      "[1]:the thought.",
      "[2]:Yeah, I uh, wasn't being serious...",
      "[2]:But seriously though, it's a really nice poem. I'd",

      "[2]:one day.",

      "[2]:Me too. I mean, I don't have much practise but any",
      "[2]:creative endeavour is kinda fun.",

      "[8]:changes that brings.",

      "[8]:and help them do better!",
      "[8]:People's expectations can sometimes be really",
      "[8]:overwhelming. If that happens, make sure you encourage",
      "[8]:yourself or your friends to be themselves and not try to",
      "[8]:conform to what other people want!",
      "[7]:Uhh... what?",
      "[4]:Hmm, that writing tip wasn't really about poetry, was it?",
      "[4]:I probably shouldn't say any more!",
      "[5]:Anyway, that's my writing tip of the day. But you've",
      "[5]:already got some writing talent, so I'm sure you'll figure",
      "[5]:a lot of things out on your own too!",
      "[4]:Sure... okay. It's been enlightening talking to you, Monika.",

      "3fc_jenny1[1]:So in other words, we get to fix Wireland too?",
      "4fc_cliffgreen1[4]:Okay, THAT sounds amazing. To finally be relevant here. So",
      "4fc_cliffgreen1[4]:what exactly do we have to do?",
      "fc_jsai[0]:Much the same thing you've seen us do in the game. We certainly",
      "fc_jsai[0]:come here enough for you to be familiar with it.",

      "fc_jsai[0]:I will be operating the machine but I believe I can accompany",
      "fc_jsai[0]:you in somnium as well. Thankfully, you will be able to keep",
      "fc_jsai[0]:both eyes.",
      "3fc_jenny1[4]:Good to know. That was gross.",
      "fc_jsai[0]:Eye injuries do tend to be a bit of",

      "4fc_cliffgreen2[15]:It's just the idea of going into my head. What if you all see",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[15]:something really embarrassing? Should I tell you all my",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[15]:secrets before we start?",
      "fc_jsai[0]:That will not be necessary. Unless you have extremely embarrassing",
      "fc_jsai[0]:memories pertaining to the games you like, that is the main",
      "fc_jsai[0]:priority so it is unlikely we will be exploring too deeply.",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[12]:Okay, that's somewhat better. It's just, you know, what",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[12]:happened in PE in third grade was embarrassing enough to",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[12]:experience once, much less as an intrusive thought when I'm",
      "4fc_cliffgreen2[12]:trying to fall asleep.",
      "3fc_jenny1[4]:That hits pretty close to home. Why do those memories like to",
      "3fc_jenny1[4]:come up when you're trying to clear your mind?",
      "fc_jsai[0]:Was that a rhetorical question?",
      "3fc_jenny1[15]:It started that way, but now I'm curious. No, we can't sit",
      "3fc_jenny1[15]:around talking about psychology. Maybe later.",
      "fc_jsai[0]:Understood. Now, since the time limit is no longer applicable,",
      "fc_jsai[0]:I will have to monitor the Psync Machine while you are in somnium,",

      "3fc_jenny1[15]:Oh yeah, doesn't one of us need to be asleep for this to work?",
      "fc_jsai[0]:Ordinarily, yes. For this particular purpose, it is better that",
      "fc_jsai[0]:you remain awake. We will be entering your files and memories, but you will",

      "fc_jsai[0]:It will be useful to set up the Wireland glitches with more",
      "fc_jsai[0]:concrete material. That way, should a character become lost,",
      "fc_jsai[0]:there will be somewhere for them to go to avoid destruction.",
